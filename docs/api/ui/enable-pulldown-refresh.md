# enablePullDownRefresh

Enables pull-down refresh.

> It is recommended to enable it after the initial data loading of the page is complete. You can also enable it directly, but make sure to handle the logic between manual pull-down refresh and page loading properly.

# Example

```typescript
import { enablePullDownRefresh } from "minip-bridge";

enablePullDownRefresh();
```
